# LinkedLists UTests

## Overview
The following is a project with emphasis on unit testing and the implementation of linear data structures. The program is designed to support common operations such as insertion, deletion, inversion and merging sorted lists; while testing can be performed on the outputs to ensure code reliability.

## Requirements
- _**Operating System**_.: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- _**.NET 8 SDK**_.: Ensure .NET 8 SDK is installed on your system.

## Functionality
## Data Structure Operations 
The data structure used includes essential operations such as.:
- Insertion
- Deletion 
- Inversion
- Merge 

### Test
The project implemented the **MSTest** framework. Tests can be run by using the following command in the respective terminal.:
